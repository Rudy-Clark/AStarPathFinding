# PathFindingAlgorithms
A* pathfinding algorithm

## Controls
Click with the mouse left button two cells to select `source` and `target`

`F` - Draw path from `source` to `target`

`R` - Redraw collisions


## Install
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Rudy-Clark/EnttPingPoing.git

And open with Visual Studio 2022. Also vcpkg package manager must be installed on your system. I'm using vcpkg.exe to include third party libraries like entt, raylib.
